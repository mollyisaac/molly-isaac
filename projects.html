                    <div> I programmed a command line interactive game in which two games alternatively take turns until a player wins, the game is a draw,
                        or either player quits.  This was implemented using the rules of both games, object-oriented programming, and polymorphic inheritance.  Below are three screenshots from the games. </div>

                    <div> This paper is the culmination of my Modern Islam course, in which we examined the development of Islam overtime and its interaction with modern influences.  In this paper, I discuss
                        the meaning of modernity and how Islam has developed overtime to meet this ever-changing definition.  This course involved in-depth analysis of the meaning of tradition.  Click on the title to read it. </div>
