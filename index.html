            <p class = "intro-paragraph"> I am a junior at Washington University in St. Louis, and I am majoring in Computer Science and Arabic.
                I aspire to work for a national defense-related company or agency so I can give back to the country that
                has given me so much.  I am particularly interested in the aerospace, cybersecurity, and intelligence industries.

            <p class = "fun-bio">I am a proud Houstonian.  I grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and I hope to return to that part of the country.
                In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, exercising, and reading.  Here are some of my recent favorite books:

                One of the highlights of my college career has been my study abroad experience in Meknes, Morocco.  The summer after my first year
                of college, I spent eight weeks living with a host family and taking four hours of Arabic language courses a day.  My Arabic skills
                were put to the test on a daily basis, from communicating basic needs with my host family to navigating around the country.  This summer
                course allowed me to advance a year in my language studies.

                Another highlight was the Bataan Memorial Death March.  My team and I rucked a marathon, each carrying 35 pounds.  It was encouraging to be surrounded by like-minded people.
