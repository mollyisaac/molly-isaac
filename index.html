        <p class="intro-paragraph"> I am a young professional beginning my career as a Cyber Software Engineer at
            Lockheed Martin Aeronautis in Fort Worth, Texas.
            I recently graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in December 2021, with a major in Computer
            Science and a minor in Arabic.
            I am passionate about working or a national defense-related company or agency so I can give back to the
            country that
            has given me so much. I am particularly interested in the aerospace, cybersecurity, and intelligence
            industries.
        </p>
        <p class="fun-bio">I am a proud Texan. I grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and I hope to return to
            that part of the country.
            In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, exercising, and reading. Here are some of
            my recent favorite books:

        <p class="fun-bio">
            One of the highlights of my college career has been my study abroad experience in Meknes, Morocco. The
            summer after my first year
            of college, I spent eight weeks living with a host family and taking four hours of Arabic language courses a
            day. My Arabic skills
            were put to the test on a daily basis, from communicating basic needs with my host family to navigating
            around the country. This summer
            course allowed me to advance a year in my language studies.

            Another highlight was the Bataan Memorial Death March. My team and I rucked a marathon, each carrying 35
            pounds. It was encouraging to be surrounded by like-minded people.
